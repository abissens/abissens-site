# Abissens

A developer blog about software development—patterns, pitfalls, and the things I wish I'd understood sooner.

## About

Abissens is a personal blog where I write about software engineering topics that rarely get the attention they deserve. 
Sometimes it's a deep dive, sometimes it's a quick note on something I stumbled upon.
