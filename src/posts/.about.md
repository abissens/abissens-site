I'm an elephant who writes code — and writes about code.


This space is my attempt to reflect on software development without hiding behind oversimplified metaphors 
or grand analogies that don't match a developer's day-to-day life.


Those of us who studied programming know our degrees borrow heavily from other engineering disciplines. 
Yet, I've never once needed topological spaces or stochastic processes to build software. 
What really matters are ideas like the Open-Closed Principle, the role of Aggregate roots, 
and the preservation of Invariants — concepts central to our craft but rarely taught in engineering school. 
Coding is not an engineering discipline, and it doesn't need to be.


We don't need to think of our architectures as buildings, our systems as recipes, or ourselves as chefs or authors. 
Software development is a discipline in its own right — with its own principles, language, and beauty.


This blog is where I share my ongoing thoughts, mistakes, and lessons on coding, design, 
and the tools we use — always trying to keep the conversation grounded in the reality of being a developer.
